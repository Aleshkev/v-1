I'm Jonas Aleshkevich. Currently, I am 16, live in Warsaw, the capital of Poland (a nation-state in eastern Europe). I attend XIV Upper Secondary School in Warsaw, one of the best in the country.

## My name, explained

TL;DR: Jonasz Aleszkiewicz = Jonas Aleshkevich, pronounce 'J' as /j/ (as in **y**et).

As I'm from Poland and I currently live there, my official name is Jonasz Aleszkiewicz. For some inexplicable reason, most of not-Polish people can't pronounce it properly.
/jɔnaʂ alɛʂkʲɛviʈ͡ʂ/! *How hard can it be?* Apparently, some people can't fluently read International Phonetic Alphabet. Yes, I was surprised too.

As a solution, I spell my name 'Jonas Aleshkevich'. Pronounce it however you like, but I'd be glad if 'J' in 'Jonas' was pronounced /j/ (as in *y*et), *not* /d͡ʑ/ or /d͡ʒ/ (as in *j*et).

*Quick sidenote: I sometimes call this form 'a transliteration' – it obviously isn't one if you know what this word means, but I couldn't find a better term; and most people don't know the difference anyway.*

Unfortunately for me, because 'Aleshkevich' is not my official name, it can't be used in official documents. And everywhere someone demands the name matches the official documents. Not much is left, but whenever possible I use 'Aleshkevich'.
